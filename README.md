## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming language with first-class functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the 6th major version of ECMAScript, ECMAScript 2015. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This course covers up to the latest version of JavaScript, which is currently ECMAScript 2019.

Why we should learn JavaScript & the reasons are:

Open Source Language: Freely Available.

Much more than Scripting programming language.

Scalability and Performance Features.

Evolving steadily & ES6 represents the BEST !!! 

Much JavaScript-related innovation in the Market.

Base of most of the frameworks like Angular.

Supported by a broad coalition of companies.
